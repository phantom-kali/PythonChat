Chat Application Documentation
Client (client.py)

    Overview:
        The client.py script represents the client side of a simple chat application.

    Dependencies:
        The script uses the socket module for networking.
        It employs multi-threading to simultaneously handle message reception and user input.

    Connection:
        The client connects to a server using the specified host and port.

    User Input:
        The user is prompted to choose a name (client_name) before connecting to the server.

    Message Reception (receive Function):
        Continuously listens for incoming messages from the server.
        When a message is received, it is decoded and displayed.
        If the message is a request for the client's name, it sends the chosen name to the server.

    Message Sending (write Function):
        Allows the user to input messages.
        Messages are sent to the server with the user's name.

Server (server.py)

    Overview:
        The server.py script represents the server side of the chat application.

    Dependencies:
        The script uses the socket module for networking.
        It utilizes multi-threading to handle multiple client connections concurrently.

    Connection:
        The server binds to the specified host and port and listens for incoming connections.

    Client Management:
        Keeps track of connected clients, their names, and the chat history.

    Broadcasting (broadcast Function):
        Sends a message to all connected clients.

    Client Handling (handle Function):
        Listens for messages from a specific client.
        Adds received messages to the chat history.
        Broadcasts the message to all clients.

    Connection Handling (receive Function):
        Accepts new client connections.
        Sends a request for the client's name.
        Adds the client to the list of connected clients.
        Starts a thread to handle communication with the new client.

    Welcome Message:
        Welcomes the first connected client with a special message.

    User Interaction:
        Displays messages about clients joining and leaving the chat.

Usage:

    Starting the Server:
        Run server.py to start the server.
        ```bash
        python server.py
        ```

    Connecting Clients:
        Run multiple instances of client.py to simulate multiple clients connecting to the server.
        ```bash
        python client.py
        ```

    Chatting:
        Clients can send and receive messages in the chat.

    Exiting:
        Clients can exit gracefully by closing the script.

Important Notes:

    The scripts use the format variable to specify the encoding format for messages (ascii in this case).

    The server and clients communicate using a simple protocol where the first message is a request for the client's name.

    Error handling is limited in this example, and improvements can be made based on specific use cases. For a production environment, consider enhancing error handling and adding security measures.

    The server displays information about connections in the console. In a real-world scenario, logging might be preferred.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this basic structure to meet your specific requirements.
